# Descripition
This project is focused on digit classification using the MNIST dataset.The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying digits from 0 to 9 based on image input.This project demonstrates fundamental image classification techniques using neural networks

# About Dataset
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each sized 28x28 pixels. The dataset includes:
- Training set: 60,000 images
- Test set: 10,000 images
- Image Dimensions: 28x28 pixels

# How to use
